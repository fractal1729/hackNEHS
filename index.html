        <p class="lead" style="color:white">We are throwing the most exciting hackathon in the New England area, exclusively for high school students. It will be a day full of developing cool ideas, meeting other high school hackers, and learning the ins and outs of development.</p>
        <p>Highschool hackathons are abundant in the west coast/California area, but are lacking on the other side of the country. hackNEHS is designed to allow high schoolers in the New England area to experience a hackathon. We want to introduce to beginners an easy way to code and spark their interests, or give more experienced coders a chance to explore new ideas and technology.</p>
        <p>Hackathons are events in which participants fully build a software project from scratch. They have become popular in tech giants, startups, and schools alike because they enable hackers to bring their ideas to life while having fun. At hackNEHS, we will have many bright high school hackers working in teams to build something awesome, with experienced mentors providing guidance along the way. We will also have hands-on workshops for novices to learn to use the hottest technologies of today, including iOS programming and web development.</p>
        <p class="lead">Location and date TBA.</p>

              <p class="faq-answer">Whether you're an experienced hacker or you've never written a line of code before, you are welcome at hackNEHS. Going to a hackathon like hackNEHS is a fantastic way to learn coding -- you’ll be able to learn everything you need to know during morning workshops, and then you can get hacking in the afternoon.  If you’re already well-versed in coding, then you can jump straight into hacking, skipping the workshops.</p>
